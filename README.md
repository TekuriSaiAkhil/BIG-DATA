# CS-GY 6513 BIG DATA Course Project at NYU, Tandon Shcool of Engineering (Spring 2024) 

## Predictive Modeling for Solar Energy Production in Europe 

  This project aims to develop a predictive model capable of forecasting solar energy output in real-time. The model utilizes extensive datasets comprising historical weather conditions, solar irradiance, and past solar energy production data sourced from Open Power System Data. By leveraging big data techniques, we aim to optimize the integration of solar energy into the power grid, improve energy resource management, and reduce reliance on non-renewable energy sources.

## Problem Statement 

  The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model capable of forecasting solar energy output in real-time. This model leverages extensive large datasets combining historical weather conditions, solar irradiance, and past solar energy production data, sourced from Open Power System Data. This is beneficial as it can help optimize the integration of solar energy into the power grid, improve the management of energy resources, and reduce reliance on non-renewable energy sources. This project addresses a significant big data challenge, requiring robust data handling, real-time analytical capabilities, and advanced predictive modeling techniques.
